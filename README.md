## App Description

The landing page of the dashboard has one global filter at
the left, namely year range. Users will be able to select a year range as desired and all sections on the landing page will get updated accordingly.
A world map is presented at the top of the dashboard with a tooltip at each countries
to show the average life expectancy data related to the selected country. Under
the world map section, there are three plots. The line graph at the left displays the average life expectancy trend over time by continents/country status with a dropdown menu and a radio button at the top. Users can select multiple continents as desired using the dropdown menu. The radio button allows users to choose to present the life expectancy trend by continents or by country status (developing vs. developed). The life expectancy trend graph in the middle would allow users to compare the average life
expectancy of a specific country against its continent and the world by changing the value in the dropdown menu. The scatter-plot at the right handside for each country with
life expectancy as a fixed y-axis and the users will be able to change
the dimension in the x-axis and color. This is required to
perform multi-dimensional analysis to understand factors affecting life
expectancy.
