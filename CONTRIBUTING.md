We welcome all contributions to this project! 

## Processing of contributing

All contributors should [fork the project](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) first, and make changes to your own fork. 

Before submitting a pull request, please open an issue in our repository and discuss it with the management team. We will verify with you that it is actually a problem. Also, you are encouraged to use [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to make communication easier and more efficient. 

When you finish your work, please feel free to [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). We will review pull requests within 7 days. 

## Fixing typos 
 
For simple typos in files under the `\src` folder, we welcome you to directly make a change to your forked repo and submit a pull request. 

## Formatting

We believe that the right formatting is essential for your contributions to make a wide and positive impact. 

 - Style guide 
 
New code should follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for R and [pandas style guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/development/code_style.html) for python. You can use the styler package to apply these styles.

We use [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) in R. Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.
